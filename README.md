# Governance & DAO Practice with Hardhat

This repository is a practice project for developing governance mechanisms and DAOs using Solidity and Hardhat. It includes a governance token and a governor contract to simulate decentralized decision-making.

## Overview

- **Governance Token:** A token that represents voting power in the DAO.
- **Governor Contract:** Manages proposals and voting processes for decentralized governance.
- **Practice Environment:** Built with Hardhat for development, testing, and deployment.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alqeren1/hardhat-governance-dao.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd hardhat-governance-dao
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

- **Compile Contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

- **Run Tests:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

- **Deploy Contracts:**

   Use the deployment scripts to deploy the governance token and governor contract:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat deploy --tags all --network localhost
   ```

## Learning Outcomes

This project was developed as a practice exercise to:

- Gain hands-on experience with creating and deploying governance tokens and DAO contracts.
- Understand the mechanisms behind decentralized governance using smart contracts.
- Learn how to test and deploy DAO-related contracts with Hardhat.
